# Features

Now that your server is up and running, you'll have access
to everything you need to manage your data, run applications,
share files across your network, and keep your system
running smoothly.

## Dashboard

Right after completing the setup wizard, you will be taken to the HexOS Dashboard.  From here, you can review system activities, apply OS updates, monitor resource usage, and control your installed applications/virtual machines.

By default you will see system information, storage, and apps on your dashboard. However this display is configurable in [settings preferences](/features/settings/#preferences).

## Notifications

HexOS provides notifications to users in two primary ways:
- All notifications are delivered to the HexOS “Bell” icon, visible on all pages.
- Critical notifications (e.g. disk failures) are also delivered automatically to you via email.

Notifications can be both marked as read and dismissed, and previous notifications can be viewed from within the messaging archive.

## Profile

Your profile menu lives in the top-right corner of every page. From there you can switch to dark mode, change languages, jump to our Community Hub, send us feedback or sign out.
