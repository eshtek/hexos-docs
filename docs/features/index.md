# Features

Once your server is up and running, you'll have access to everything you need to manage your data, run applications, share files across your network, and keep your system running smoothly.

This introduction will briefly describe the main screens within HexOS. There are more detailed chapters on each screen in the links below or in the docs menu.

## HexOS Screens

### Dashboard

The Dash  is where you arrive after completing the setup wizard and when you log in via [deck.hexos.com](https://deck.hexos.com)

From the dashboard you can review system activities, apply OS updates, monitor resource usage, and control your installed applications/virtual machines. Anything that requires your attention will show an alert icon or error message.

By default you will see system information, storage, and apps on your dashboard. However this display is configurable in [settings preferences](/features/settings/index/#preferences).

### Storage

This is where you'll find all your pools and drives, and handle anything related to storage. Whether it's creating new pools, adding more space, swapping drives, or fixing any issues that pop up.

### Folders

In HexOS you can organise your files and backups into folders. 

Some folders are automatically created when applications are installed, these are called System Folders.

You can also create folders yourself, these will show under My Folders. These can be used for sharing files over your network or backing up other devices (Apple Time Machine, Windows Backup, etc) or simply for keeping your data organised.

You can also create additional users and choose what each user may access with the permissions settings.

### Apps

HexOS uses apps to add additional features. The easiest apps to try are curated apps, these can be installed and configured with a single click. There are other ways to install apps also.

### Settings

If you need to tweak how your server behaves, then the Settings page is the place to go. This is where you'll find all the configuration options, from network setup to customizing your dashboard to choosing where different types of files get stored. This is also where you can enter the TrueNAS interface, the underlying software HexOS is built on.

### Notifications

HexOS will notify you of disk failures, issues with system functioning, updates and more.

### Profile

Your profile menu lives in the top-right corner of every page. From there you can switch to dark mode, change languages, jump to our Community Hub, send us feedback or sign out.
