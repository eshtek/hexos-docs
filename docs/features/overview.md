# Features  

some text that gives an introduction to what all the features encompass.

## Dashboard

Immediately after completing the setup wizard, you will be first taken to the HexOS Dashboard.  From here, you can review system activities, apply OS updates, monitor resource usage, and control your installed applications/virtual machines.

By default you will see information on your system, (activity messages, hardware information) storage, and apps. However this display is configurable in [setttings].

## Notifications

HexOS provides notifications to users in two primary ways:
- All notifications are delivered to the HexOS “Bell” icon, visible on all pages.
- Critical notifications (e.g. disk failures) are also delivered automatically to you via email.

Notifications can be both marked as read and dismissed, and previous notifications can be viewed from within the messaging archive.

## Profile

Your user profile is also available on all pages of HexOS, where you can toggle dark mode, launch the Community Hub, give feedback to us, or logout.
