# Apps

This is where all your applications live. You can install curated apps with one click, use community contributions, create custom installs, or go through the full TrueNAS catalog.

## Eshtek Curations

The HexOS team has created curated install scripts that handle all the configuration automatically, so you just click install and everything works. Over time we will continue to expand the curated section even further.

## Community Curations

Community members can contribute app curations to expand what's available beyond the official catalog. If there's an app you want but don't see a curation for it, you can make one yourself.

*(I imagine we should talk about the process of adding their curations?)*

## Install Scripts

For non-curated apps, you can use custom install scripts to get them running. You can also view and modify the install scripts to fit your specific needs.  
This requires enabling [experimental features](/features/settings/#preferences) in your preferences.

Learn more about [install scripts](/features/apps/install-scripts/overview). 

## TrueNAS Catalog

For advanced users who want access to everything, the full TrueNAS app catalog gives you hundreds of applications with complete control over their configuration. You're on your own for setup and troubleshooting, but you get maximum flexibility.
