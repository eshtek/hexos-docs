## About Curated Apps

HexOS provides curated install scripts for popular home server applications. These apps have been tested and configured to work seamlessly with HexOS, but each app is maintained by its respective development team.

For information about creating your own install scripts or contributing to the curated collection, see the [Install Scripts documentation](/features/apps/install-scripts/overview).
