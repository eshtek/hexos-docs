## Options

### Folder storage limit  <small>(optional)</small>
In this section you can set a maximum amount of disk space the folder may use. This helps manage disk usage when multiple people or applications share your server.

### Backup <small>(optional)</small>
You can Enable Time Machine by selecting the checkbox. Enabling this feature sets up the folder with the proper configuration for Apple's Time Machine backup system.

## Encryption  <small>(optional)</small>
You can optionally enable encryption on folders you create. [Read about encrypted folders here.](/features/folders/index.md#encrypted-folders) 
- The passphrase must be at least 8 characters long. 
- Encryption is required for backing up a folder to another server. 
- <span style="color: red;">Data from encrypted folders cannot be recovered if the passphrase is lost.</span>
