When creating a folder, first give it a name. You then have several other options that you may configure. You can skip this to use the default settings by clicking Continue.

### Location
This is which pool your folder will be on. If you have only one pool then this will be automatically selected. If you have multiple pools, perhaps with different performance characteristics or purposes, then select one here.

### Access
On the menu select Access. Here you can choose who has access to this folder and what permissions they have. This is covered in more detail in the [Folder Permissions section](/folders/##folder-permissions.

###Options

#### Quota
On the Options section you can set a maximum amount of disk space the folder may use up. This helps manage disk usage when multiple people or applications share your server.

#### Time Machine
On this same Options section you can Enable Time Machine. Enabling this feature sets up the folder with the proper configuration for Apple's backup system.

### Encryption
You can optionally enable encryption on folders you create. [Read about encrypted folders](LINK)here. The password must be at least 8 characters long. Encryption is required for backing up a folder to another server.

**Important** Encryption can only be enabled during folder creation and cannot be disabled once the folder is created, nor can the passphrase be changed. 

### Finishing up creating a folder

Once you have checked your settings press Continue and check the details in the overview. If you wish to change anything, press the back button and edit the settings. When you are ready click Create and then the folder will be created. This may take a few moments. When the folder is created you will see it on the Folders screen.


## Editing folder settings

Only some settings may be changed later. Folders cannot be renamed and encryption settings canâ€™t be changed later.To edit the settings for a folder go to Folders then click the folder you wish to edit.
