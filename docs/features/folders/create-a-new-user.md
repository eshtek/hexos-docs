# How to create a new user

If you want to share selected folders or files with someone who has access to your wifi network, the best way to do this is by adding a new user in HexOS. 

You can control which folders the user can access, and what they can do with them - just view or also edit and delete folder contents.

This user can’t access any other part of your server, for example they can’t access the HexOS dashboard or your Immich photos. This is just about folders on the network.

You don’t *need* to add more users, it’s okay to keep using your admin username and password for everything. You could also create a user for yourself to use day to day, if you feel this would be more secure.

## Adding a new user

On your [deck](https://deck.hexos.com) go to the **Folders** screen. There click **Add new** under the **Users** section. (Your admin account dosen't show up in this list of users).

Fill out a **Username** and **Password** then click **Add account**

The user will then appear in the deck under the **Users** section of the **Folders** screen. This might take a few moments.

## Changing the password of a user

You can change the username or set a new password for an existing user. First go to the **Folders** screen on your [deck](https://deck.hexos.com) and then click on the user you wish to edit

## How can a user access folders

When you [create](/features/folders/create-a-new-folder) or [edit](/features/folders/create-a-new-folder/#editing-folder-settings) a folder you can choose which users may access the contents and what permissions they have. 

You can read about the **Access** settings on the [create a new folder](/features/folders/create-a-new-folder/#access) page here.

The user will need to ser up access to the folders on their computer or phone as described in the [how to access folders guide](/folders/how-to-access-folder-contents). 

Their device will prompt them for the username and password when they try to access a private folder. They may be able to see other folders and the folder names but the user will only be able to access the folders they have been granted permission to access.
