# How to Access Files and Folders Over the Network

Each folder has a **Browse** button that gives you the address you need to connect to it from your device. If you created a private folder you will need to connect to that folder using the associated Users credentials.

## On Mac
Open Finder, click "Go" in the menu bar, select "Connect to Server". Paste the SMB link into the "Server Address" field and click "Connect".

## On Windows
Open File Explorer, right-click on "This PC", then "Map network drive". Paste the SMB link into the "Folder" field and click "Finish" to connect.

## On ChromeOS

Open the Files app, click the More menu (three-dots), click Services, then click SMB File Share. Then either select a suggested share or manually enter the URL using the format \\\\192.168.1.73\\Public. Fill out the fields and save.

## On Linux

This varies depending on your linux OS, however, the url required will probably be similar to the Mac one, with forward slashes smb://192.168.1.201/Folder (rather than windows and chrome with \\ back slashes)
