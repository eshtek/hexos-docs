# Settings

Need to tweak how your server behaves? This is where you'll find all the configuration options, from network setup to customizing your dashboard to choosing where different types of files get stored.

## System

### Network

Configure your server's network connection and how devices reach it. Set up network interfaces with static IPs if needed, change your server's hostname, and handle advanced networking like VLANs for complex setups.

### Preferences

Fine tune your HexOS experience with dashboard controls.  
Toggle entire dashboard sections (storage, apps, system) or drill down to individual items - hide specific storage pools, system health metrics, processor info, memory usage, or individual network interfaces. Change your language, switch to dark mode, and enable [experimental features](/features/settings/experimental-features/).

## Reset Options

Sometimes you need a fresh start, or want to hand your server off to someon eelse. Currently you have two options. 

- **Unclaim Server** will remove your server from our database. Nothing happens to the physical server. You will no longer be able to access it through HexOS, but it can be reclaimed.
- **Wipe everything** will delete all data on all drives and reset your server to defaults.

## Applications

### Locations

A comprehensive location editor where you can customize paths for applications and folders. Set where applications install, choose storage locations for downloads, documents, media files, virtual machines, and more across your different storage pools.
