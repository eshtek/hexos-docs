# Experimental Features

Advanced functionality that's still being refined. These features are stable enough to use but aren't quite ready for everyday users. They may have rough edges, or require more technical knowledge to use effectively.

Enable experimental features in your preferences when you want access to advanced functionality.

## Current Features

- **Custom Install Scripts** - View and edit the install scripts that power app installations. Customize configurations or create scripts for non-curated apps.

- **Advanced Encryption Options** - Access additional encryption settings when creating folders, beyond the standard encryption toggle.
