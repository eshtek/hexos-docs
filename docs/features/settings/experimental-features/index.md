# Experimental Features

Advanced functionality that's still being refined. These features are stable enough to use but aren't quite ready for everyday users. They may have rough edges, or require more technical knowledge to use effectively.

In order to enable experimental features go to `preferences` inside of `Settings`. There you should see a toggle for experimental features.

## Current Features

- **Custom Install Scripts** - View and edit the install scripts that power app installations. Customize configurations or create scripts for non-curated apps.

- **Edit App Locations** - Modify storage locations and paths for already installed apps. Allows you to relocate app data after initial installation without reinstalling.  
*(Learn how to [migrate your data here](/guides/manual-data-migration).)*

- **Advanced Encryption Options** - Access additional encryption settings when creating folders, beyond the standard encryption toggle.

- **Task Dismissal** - Manually dismiss stale or stuck tasks from the Activities panel. Useful when operations complete but tasks remain active.
