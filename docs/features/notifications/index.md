# Notifications

HexOS provides notifications to users in two primary ways:

- All notifications are delivered to the HexOS "Bell" icon, visible on all pages.  
- Critical notifications (e.g. disk failures) are also delivered automatically to you via email.

Notifications can be both marked as read and dismissed, and previous notifications can be viewed from within the messaging archive.

## SMART Errors

Your drives collect health data that HexOS monitors for potential problems. When you see SMART errors, it means the system has detected something that warrants investigation. This could indicate a drive issue that needs attention, but doesn't necessarily mean immediate replacement is required.

## System Health Notifications

HexOS monitors your server's hardware and storage systems. You'll get alerts for things like overheating, storage pool problems, or missing drives that need your attention.

## Task Notifications

When you start operations that take time to complete, such as 
installing apps, managing storage, or system updates, HexOS
shows you a task so you know something is happening in the
background.

## Managing Notifications

You have control over how notifications appear and persist in your system. You can mark notifications as read by clicking on them, dismiss them when you've handled them, or use "Mark All as Read" and "Dismiss All" to handle multiple notifications at once. You can also view older notifications in the archive, with all notification history accessible through the [activity messages](/features/settings/#activity-history) page.
