# Community Contributions

HexOS grows stronger with community involvement. Whether you're a developer, writer, or enthusiast, there are many ways to contribute to the project and help other users.

## Help Curate Applications (Install Scripts)

One of the most valuable contributions is helping expand the available applications. You can test existing community scripts and provide feedback, create install scripts for new applications, improve documentation with setup guides and troubleshooting tips, or help review submissions for quality and compatibility.

## Write and Submit Code

Developers can contribute directly to the HexOS codebase by fixing bugs, enhancing existing features, optimizing performance, or adding automated tests. The process involves forking the repository, making your changes, and submitting a pull request for review by the HexOS team.

## Improve Our Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome. Fix errors and outdated information, fill gaps for missing features, rewrite confusing sections to be clearer, or add real-world examples and use cases. Documentation contributions follow the same pull request process as code.

## Support Other Users

Help build a supportive community on our forums and Reddit. Share your knowledge to solve problems, post working configurations for common setups, help debug tricky issues, and welcome newcomers to make the community friendly for new users.

## Apply to be a Moderator

Experienced community members can apply to help moderate forums and maintain a positive environment. This involves community leadership, content moderation, conflict resolution, and helping the community grow. Applications are reviewed based on community involvement, technical knowledge, and communication skills.
