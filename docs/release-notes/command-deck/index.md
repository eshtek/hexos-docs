## How Updates Work

Command Deck updates are automatically deployed by the HexOS development team. You don't need to take any action to receive these updates - they will appear automatically when you next visit the Command Deck.

For users who are actively connected during an update, there may be a brief downtime of a minute or two as the new version is deployed.
