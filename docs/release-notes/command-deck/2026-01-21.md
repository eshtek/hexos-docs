# January 21, 2026 - Mobile Dialogs, App Lifecycle, Polish, HexOS Local Prep

This release introduces improved app lifecycle management, mobile-optimized dialogs, and lays the groundwork for HexOS Local.

## Enhancements

### App Lifecycle Management

App start and stop operations are now individually orchestrated, providing better progress tracking and improved update workflows. App cards display server messages directly from TrueNAS, surfacing any startup configuration issues or lifecycle problems immediately for faster troubleshooting.

### Mobile-Optimized Dialogs

We're testing a new dialog on mobile to give better accessibility and reach. These appear as traditional modals on desktop and slide-up drawers on mobile. These have been applied to folders, users, and network settings.

### Interface Polish

We've refined the header styling and various UI elements throughout the interface. This includes improved input field borders and focus states, consistent button styling across dialogs, better light/dark mode transitions for dialog titles, and fixed button sizing inconsistencies.

### HexOS Local Preparation

This release also pushes a large block of code behind the scenes that will support the coming soon [HexOS Local](https://docs.hexos.com/blog/2025-11-25.html)
