# January 8, 2026 - HexOS Curated Apps & Enhanced Diagnostics

This release introduces a dedicated HexOS curated apps section and improved diagnostic capabilities.

## Enhancements

### HexOS Curated Apps Section

We've added a new "HexOS" category that filters apps to show only those officially supported for HexOS. This category includes a dedicated icon and ensures correct search filtering, making it easier to find apps that are tested and optimized for your HexOS system.

### Diagnostic Reporting

We've enhanced our diagnostic infrastructure to capture more detailed technical information when system events occur. This helps us identify and resolve issues more quickly.

**Technical improvements:**
- Enhanced diagnostic data collection during system events
- Improved error context capture for faster troubleshooting
- More comprehensive system state reporting

These improvements allow us to better understand and address technical issues across the platform.
