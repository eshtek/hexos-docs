# January 13, 2026 - UI Improvements & Goldeye System Updates

This release includes UI polish and platform enhancements for TrueNAS Goldeye (25.10+) system updates.

## Enhancements

### UI Text Refinements

We've refined wording throughout the interface for improved clarity and consistency, including system health messages, setup wizard text, drive replacement descriptions, and error notifications.

### Goldeye System Update Integration

The platform now uses the latest TrueNAS API methods for system updates on Goldeye (25.10+) and newer versions, utilizing the current update APIs for checking availability and initiating updates.

**Technical improvements:**
- System update workflow uses `update.status` and `update.run` APIs for Goldeye (25.10+)
- Maintains full backward compatibility with Electric Eel and earlier versions
