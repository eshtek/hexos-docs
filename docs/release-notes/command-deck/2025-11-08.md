# Hotfix - November 8, 2025 - Server monitoring scalability improvements

Pushing out an important infrastructure update today to improve platform scalability and performance.

## Performance Improvements

- **Enhanced server monitoring architecture for scale** - With the latest Fangtooth release compatibility requiring real-time system reporting subscriptions, we've implemented intelligent timing that distributes server check-ins evenly. When hundreds or thousands of servers connect simultaneously, they now gracefully determine their update intervals preventing infrastructure bottlenecks to ensure your Command Deck stays responsive.
