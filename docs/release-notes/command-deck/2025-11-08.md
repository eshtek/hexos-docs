# Hotfix - November 8, 2025 - Server monitoring scalability improvements

Pushing out an important infrastructure update today to improve platform scalability and performance.

## Performance Improvements

- **Enhanced server monitoring architecture for scale** - With the latest Fangtooth release compatibility requiring real-time system reporting endpoints, we've implemented intelligent subscription timing that distributes server check-ins evenly across time. When dozens or hundreds of servers connect simultaneously, they now gracefully stagger their update intervals with smart randomization—preventing infrastructure bottlenecks to ensure your Command Deck stays responsive.
