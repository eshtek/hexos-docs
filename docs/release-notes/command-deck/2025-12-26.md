# December 26, 2025 - Apps Overhaul, 2FA, GPU Detection, Goldeye Compatibility

This release introduces an improved Apps experience, new apps, two-factor authentication support, improved GPU support, and Goldeye compatibility.

## Apps Overhaul
The apps section has been redesigned along with additional curations. New features include seeing a list of trending apps across HexOS, recently curated section, category browsing, and search. 

### New Curations
- **[Bazarr](https://www.bazarr.media/)** - Automated subtitle management for your media library
- **[Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/)** - Real-time performance monitoring and visualization
- **[Scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny)** - Hard drive health monitoring and S.M.A.R.T. data analysis
- **[Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/)** - Professional video transcoding and conversion
- **[File Flows](https://fileflows.com/)** - Intelligent file processing and automation workflows

- **[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)** - A continuous file synchronization program
- **[Emby](https://emby.media/)** - Feature-rich media server and streaming platform

## Two-Factor Authentication
You can enable 2FA in your security settings here: [Hub: Security Settings](https://hub.hexos.com/settings/account-security/).

## Goldeye Support
TrueNAS 25.10.1 support and upgradability from within Deck. This release uses the NVIDIA open GPU kernel, bringing [wider support](https://forums.truenas.com/t/nvidia-compatible-driver-test-for-truenas-25-10-goldeye/53395) to NVIDIA GPUs. 

## GPU Detection Improvements
We've upgraded our install scripts (v3) that allow for semantic versioning and additional macros for app curation. The new `$GPU_CONFIG()` macro detects compatible GPUs and will configure UUIDs automatically. For detailed documentation, please refer to the [Schema](/features/apps/install-scripts/reference/schema.html) and [Macros](/features/apps/install-scripts/reference/macros.html) documentation.


## General Improvements
We've added additional badging across the deck to indicate expert and experimental features with toggles under [Preferences](https://deck.hexos.com/settings/preferences) to show or hide these. You will also find more consistent dialogs, improved responsiveness on mobile, and other miscellaneous UI and accessibility tweaks.
