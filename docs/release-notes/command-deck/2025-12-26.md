## Apps Platform Overhaul

This release introduces a major overhaul of the HexOS Apps platform, delivering significant improvements in functionality, performance, and user experience.

### New Features

#### Enhanced Search and Discovery
- **Popular Apps Section**: Discover trending and widely-used applications
- **Recently Curated**: A section dedicated to new app releases
- **Category Navigation**: Browse apps by category (Media, Productivity, Development, etc.)
- **Full-Text Search**: Search across app names, descriptions, and tags
- **Experimental Badge**: Clear identification of experimental curations
- **New Curations**: We've expanded our library again with additional curations. Theres a handful so check out the deck to see what is new.

#### Script Versioning (v3)
- **Versioned Install Scripts**: All app install scripts now support semantic versioning, enabling controlled updates and rollbacks
- **Update Compatibility**: Scripts can define compatibility constraints to ensure safe updates between versions
- **Change Logs**: Each script version includes detailed change logs to track modifications

#### Advanced Configuration Macros
The new macro system provides powerful conditional logic and dynamic configuration capabilities:

- **`$GPU_CONFIG()` Macro**: Automatic GPU detection and configuration
  - Detects available NVIDIA GPUs on the system
  - Generates proper GPU resource allocations for containers

- **`$IF()` Conditional Macro**: Enables conditional configuration based on user responses
  ```json
  "$IF($QUESTION(enable_gpu), \"$GPU_CONFIG()\", null)"
  ```

- **`$APP_INSTALLED()` Macro**: Combined with conditionals can conditional map specific paths
  ```json
  "$IF($APP_INSTALLED(qbittorent), $MOUNTED_HOST_PATH($LOCATION(Downloads)/qbittorrent, /config/Downloads)"
  ```

#### App Curator Features
- **Expert Mode**: Advanced users are able to access certain functionality for curation and configuration with links to TrueNAS where appropriate
- **Script Update Detection**: Automatic detection when newer script versions are available
- **Configuration Reset**: Ability to reset app configuration to the latest recommended defaults
- **Update Configuration**: Apply new configurations without reinstalling the app

### Technical Improvements


#### For App Curators
1. Going forward add version metadata to your install scripts:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 3,
     "script": {
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "updateCompatibility": ">=1.0.0 <2.0.0",
       "changeLog": "Updated gpu configuration"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Implement conditional logic using new macros where appriate:
   ```json
   {
     "config": {
       "gpus": "$IF($QUESTION(enable_gpu), \"$GPU_CONFIG()\", null)"
     }
   }
   ```
