# February 7, 2025 - Improved Setup wizard w/ existing data detection

We are releasing a minor update today. Here are the main changes:

## Key Features

- **Improved Setup Wizard Functionality** - Enhancements in detecting system details during setup, with additional warnings and error messaging to help identify potential problems
- **Existing Data Detection** - The software now detects existing drive partitions during setup. If any exist, they will be flagged for your attention
- **Minor UI Improvements** - A number of small user interface issues have been resolved to provide a smoother experience (e.g., when scrolling through long content on larger displays, the detail panel will remain fixed and visible)

You will receive these updates automatically on your next visit to the Command Deck. For those actively connected, there may be a brief moment of downtime to ensure everything is working correctly.
