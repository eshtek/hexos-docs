# Command Deck Update - July 28, 2025

Another Command Deck update went live today.

This release includes:

- Fixes to the networking layer for users switching between DHCP and static IP modes
- Improved performance across the app based on the observability metrics added last release
- A new queuing and caching layer to handle folder loading for users with a large number of folders, preventing API overload with TrueNAS
- A fix for a bug that caused folders to appear missing when a private folder user had been deleted

Performance work is ongoing. Let us know if you spot anything.
