# December 30, 2025 - Hotfix : App Configuration Updates

Following user feedback, we've removed the "updated script available" notification and improved how app configuration updates work.

## Enhancements

### Updated Configuration Workflow

Configuration updates now expand under the Options dialog for manual application. When we introduce updated curations with new functionality like automatic GPU detection, you can take advantage of these improvements on your own timeline.

The reset|update action now always shows a confirmation dialog with improved messaging.
