# Command Deck Update - November 6, 2025 - Install Script v2, Fangtooth Support, Enhanced User Management

Smarter app installations, TrueNAS Fangtooth compatibility, and refined user controls.

## TrueNAS Fangtooth Support

HexOS now fully supports TrueNAS 25.04 and the latest Fangtooth release. This update includes:

- Ability to upgrade from TrueNas Electric Eel to Fangtooth within the command Deck
- Automatic ZFS pool upgrades after server updates
- Improved version detection for feature compatibility across different TrueNAS releases setting the groundwork for the larger Goldeye release

## App Install Scripts v2 with Interactive Questions
We're introducing a major upgrade to our app curation system with Install Script v2. Install scripts can now present interactive questions during the installation process for user preferences.

When installing supported apps like Jellyfin, you'll see prompts for configuration options like GPU acceleration settings. Questions can include helpful descriptions and smart defaults (including auto-generated secure passwords), making complex or sensitive app installations curatable.  We have numerous apps now queued up to be released in the coming weeks. 

For developers and curators, this opens up new possibilities for adding to our app catalog. Check out our updated [Install Script documentation](/features/apps/install-scripts/reference/schema) to learn how to create Install Script v2 templates with interactive questions.

Key features:
- Dynamic configuration prompts with text inputs, dropdowns, number fields, and toggles
- Contextual help text and smart defaults for every option
- Increased security by obfuscating any sensitive information entirely from our databases
- Clean uninstalls with optional app data and configuration removal


## Enhanced User Management

User management gets more powerful with new visibility into folder permissions:

- **Folder Access Display**: View which folders a user can access directly on their detail page
- **Direct Folder Links**: Direct links to specific folders for faster more intuitive navigation when setting up your server
