# Command Deck Update - October 7, 2025

Pushing out a small patch today.
This release addresses issues with server connections and app installation issues.

## Bug Fixes

### Server Connection
Fixed authentication compatibility with TrueNAS 25.x servers.
- Users who upgraded to TrueNAS 25.x or had two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled may have been unable to connect.

:::info
Two-factor authentication (2FA) is not yet supported and will be addressed in a future update.
:::

### App Installation
Fixed issue with long running app installs.
- App installations that took longer than 2 minutes were incorrectly marked as failed, even when they completed successfully. The timeout handling has been improved to properly handle longer running app installs.

## Forums
