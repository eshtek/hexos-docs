# Hotfix - October 7, 2025

Pushing out a small patch today.  
This release addresses issues with app installations and includes updates to the forums.

## Bug Fixes

### App Installation

Fixed issue with long running app installs.
- App installations that took longer than 2 minutes were incorrectly marked as failed, even when they completed successfully. The timeout handling has been improved to properly handle longer running app installs.

## Forums

Along with these small bug fixes, you may notice a few changes around the hub.
We've added new sections for each curated app supported by HexOS. This update will help us stay organized and respond more efficiently to issues related to app curation. It also makes it easier for us to share announcements, provide updates on ongoing bugs, and post solutions as they become available.

## Immich

Following our recent Q3 update, you may have noticed some issues with Immich. Weâ€™re aware of what users are experiencing and are preparing a guide to help address these problems, which should be available soon.
