# Command Deck Update - January 8, 2025 - Manual WAN IP Specification, Additional Confirmations for Destructive Actions

We are releasing an update today. You will automatically receive these changes on your next visit to the Command Deck. For users who are actively connected, please note there may be a brief downtime of a minute or two.

## Key Features

### Manual WAN IP Specification

This update includes an important feature for users who have previously encountered issues claiming their HexOS server due to certain network configurations. These configurations caused communication problems between the server and the Command Deck, preventing automatic server detection after installation due to an IP mismatch.

You can now manually specify the WAN IP address to assist in the server discovery process when claiming your server.

## Additional Improvements

- Additional confirmations for destructive actions to help avoid accidental operations
- Improved grammar and spelling throughout
- Clearer instructions for accessing the TrueNAS UI from Settings
- Better logging to help dev/user experience
