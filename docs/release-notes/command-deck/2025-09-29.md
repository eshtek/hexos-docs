# Command Deck Update - September 29, 2025 - New Apps Curation Process, Jellyfin/Home Assistant/qBittorrent Apps, Folder Wizard

New Apps, Curation Process and Folder updates

## Additional Apps
We've just added Jellyfin, Home Assistant, and qBittorrent! And this is just the beginning, thanks to our new curation process, we expect many more apps to come online soon.

## Intro to App Curation
We've added an interface to the HexOS frontend to make iterating on apps easier and to let the community contribute their own curations. By enabling Dev Mode in Preferences, you'll unlock the Custom Script option for app installs. From there, you can tweak existing install scripts or create new ones then share them with friends or submit them to the official HexOS curation templates.

Right now, the feature focuses on streamlining the app install process. Soon we plan to surface installer questions directly in the UI and automate post-install steps (such as in-app setup wizards). That work depends on the in-development Local UI project, we will share more news about this in the future.

We'd love your feedback as we refine this, let us know what's working well and where you're running into friction.

## Docsite
We've launched a documentation site!  
This new resource brings together everything you need to know about HexOS, including getting started guides, feature documentation, troubleshooting help, release notes, and community resources.

### Contributing to HexOS

- **Community Contributions**: Find out how to contribute to documentation, guides, and more in our [Community section](/community/)

## First Flight Updates
We've made improvements to First Flight, our onboarding experience, to help new users get up and running with HexOS more easily.

Key improvements include:
- **Progress Tracking**: When you complete tasks shown in the First Flight modal, it will pop up again to show you which tasks you've completed and what's still left to do
- **Persistent Banner**: A banner now lives at the top of every page, keeping First Flight guidance accessible throughout HexOS 

This feature is designed to make the HexOS onboarding process a little more intuitive, especially for users new to home server management.

## Folder Wizard Arrives
We've extended our simple folder creation interface with a new wizard-driven process that unlocks specialized use cases like encrypted folders and Time Machine backups. With this foundation in place, we're now ready to move forward on bigger features including Snapshots, Replication, and Buddy Backup.
