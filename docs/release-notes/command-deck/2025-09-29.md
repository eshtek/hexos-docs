New Apps, Curation Process and Folder updates

## Additional Apps
We've just added Jellyfin, Home Assistant, and qBittorrent! And this is just the beginning, thanks to our new curation process, we expect many more apps to come online soon.

## Intro to App Curation
We've added an interface to the HexOS frontend to make iterating on apps easier and to let the community contribute their own curations. By enabling Dev Mode in Preferences, you'll unlock the Custom Script option for app installs. From there, you can tweak existing install scripts or create new ones then share them with friends or submit them to the official HexOS curation templates.

Right now, the feature focuses on streamlining the app install process. Soon we plan to surface installer questions directly in the UI and automate post-install steps (such as in-app setup wizards). That work depends on the in-development Local UI project, we will share more news about this in the future.

We'd love your feedback as we refine this, let us know what's working well and where you're running into friction.

If you would like to contribute your curation to the official HexOS app curations you can follow this guide, or just share your install script in our [forums](https://hub.hexos.com/):
1. Test your custom curation in HexOS and verify it works
2. Click Here
3. Click the green "Fork this repository"
4. Paste the contents of your install script into the editor and press the green "Commit Changes"
5. Click the green "Create pull request" on the following page
6. In your PR description, include any callouts (unique mounts, GPU usage, special env, etc.)

## Folder Wizard Arrives
We've extended our simple folder creation interface with a new wizard-driven process that unlocks specialized use cases like encrypted folders and Time Machine backups. With this foundation in place, we're now ready to move forward on bigger features including Snapshots, Replication, and Buddy Backup.
