# Command Deck Update - October 27, 2025

We have a Command Deck update to start off the week!

###  What's New

Here's exactly what this new update brings:

- **Custom App Installation Questions**: Configure apps during installation by answering simple questions
- **Update Location Paths**: Reorganize your storage without breaking apps or reinstalling
- **TrueNAS SCALE 25.04 Support**: Full compatibility with TrueNAS SCALE 25.04

## Custom App Installation Questions

Previously, if an app needed custom configuration like an API key, you'd include it in a custom install script. While HexOS never used or shared that data, it would be temporarily stored as part of your last script.

The new installation questions feature lets you provide these details right when you install the app, making setup simpler and keeping sensitive information more private.

With installation questions:
- **Secrets stay separate**: Your API keys and passwords are entered as interactive questions, not stored in scripts
- **Cleaner scripts**: The script template stays generic and reusable
- **Better privacy**: Sensitive details are only used for that installation and aren't saved in the script history

## Update Location Paths

Need to reorganize your storage? Maybe you added a new drive and want to move your Photos location, or you're consolidating everything onto a larger pool. HexOS now handles that path change automatically.

### How To Update a Location Path

1. Enable **Experimental Features** in `Settings` > `Preferences`
2. Go to `Settings` > `Locations`
3. Select a location (like Photos or Media) and click edit
4. Choose the new storage path
5. HexOS automatically updates all affected apps to use the new location

We are currently just handling the actual path updating. This means you will need to manually move your files from the old location to the new one. Our [Manual Data Migration](/guides/manual-data-migration) guide walks you through the entire process.

This guide is just to hold you over for a little while as we develop automatic data migration.

## TrueNAS SCALE 25.04 Support

HexOS now supports TrueNAS SCALE 25.04.   
Users should see an "Update Available" notification under the Activity Center once you login. Once you engage the update, do NOT power off your system. Wait for the update to download and restart your server automatically. Your system will automatically reconnect to the Command Deck when complete. The time this process can take will vary based on your Internet connection.
