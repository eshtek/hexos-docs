# Command Deck Update - October 27, 2025

We have a Command Deck update to start off the week!

###  What's New

Here's exactly what this new update brings:

- **TrueNAS SCALE 25.04 (Fangooth) Support**: Full compatibility with the latest TrueNAS release
- **Custom App Installation Questions**: Configure apps during installation by answering simple questions
- **Update Location Paths**: Reorganize your storage without breaking apps or reinstalling

## TrueNAS SCALE 25.04 Support

:::tip Fangooth Compatibility
HexOS now fully supports TrueNAS SCALE 25.04 (Fangooth).

Users should see an "Update Available" notification under the Activity Center once you login. Once you engage the update, do NOT power off your system. Wait for the update to download and restart your server automatically. Your system will automatically reconnect to the Command Deck when complete. The time this process can take will vary based on your Internet connection.


## Custom App Installation Questions

In our [September 29th](/release-notes/command-deck/2025-09-29) release, we introduced custom app installs to give you more flexibility when setting up apps. We're continuing to build on that foundation with a new addition to install scripts.

During installations with custom app install, you'll now be prompted with questions, allowing apps to request setup details like API keys or passwords at install time instead of requiring them in the script itself. This keeps scripts reusable while keeping your sensitive information private. 

:::tip 
If you haven't used install scripts previously, you will need to enable experimental features ([read about experimental features here](/features/settings/experimental-features/)).

## Update Location Paths

Need to reorganize your storage? Maybe you added a new drive and want to move your Photos location, or you're consolidating everything onto a larger pool. HexOS now handles that path change automatically.

### How To Update a Location Path

1. Enable **Experimental Features** in `Settings` > `Preferences`
2. Go to `Settings` > `Locations`
3. Select a location (like Photos or Media) and click edit
4. Choose the new storage path
5. HexOS automatically updates all affected apps to use the new location

We are currently just handling the actual path updating. This means you will need to manually move your files from the old location to the new one. Our [Manual Data Migration](/guides/manual-data-migration) guide walks you through the entire process.

This guide is just to hold you over for a little while as we develop automatic data migration.
