# Command Deck Update - October 27, 2025

We're excited to announce a major improvement to how you manage storage in HexOS: **Location Path Updates**.

## New Feature: Update Location Paths

You can now reorganize your storage without breaking app configurations or reinstalling apps!

### What's New

**Update Location Paths** - Change where your locations point without interrupting your apps:
- Automatically detects which apps are using a location
- Updates all app configurations to point to the new path
- Sets proper permissions on the new location
- Records all changes in Activity History
- Keeps your apps working throughout the process

This feature is the first step toward complete storage reorganization. While HexOS now handles updating paths and configurations automatically, you'll still need to manually move your data files (automatic data migration is coming soon).

### How to Use It

1. Enable **Experimental Features** in `Settings` > `Preferences`
2. Go to `Settings` > `Locations`
3. Select a location and click the edit button
4. Choose your new path
5. HexOS automatically reconfigures all affected apps

For complete instructions, see our new [Manual Data Migration](/guides/manual-data-migration) guide, which walks you through the entire process including moving your data.

### What This Means

Previously, reorganizing storage meant:
- Breaking app paths
- Manually reconfiguring each app
- Or reinstalling apps entirely

Now HexOS handles the configuration updates automatically. Once automatic data migration is added, the entire process will be seamless.

## New Guides

We've added comprehensive guides to help you work with this new feature:

- **[Manual Data Migration](/guides/manual-data-migration)** - Complete walkthrough for reorganizing storage, including updating location paths and moving data

## What's Next

Automatic data migration is in development. When released, HexOS will handle moving your files automatically when you update a location path - no manual rsync commands needed.

Stay tuned for updates!
