# Hotfix - November 7, 2025

Pushing out a small patch today to improve upgrade reliability for older hardware.

## Bug Fixes

- **Increased timeout thresholds for major TrueNAS version upgrades** - Extended the staleness timeout window when upgrading between major TrueNAS versions (e.g., Electric Eel → Fangtooth). This prevents false-negative upgrade failure reports on older hardware that requires additional time to complete the upgrade process. Systems that successfully upgraded to Fangtooth without errors will no longer be incorrectly flagged as failed due to timeout constraints.
