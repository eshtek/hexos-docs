# Complete Server Setup

Now that HexOS is installed, you’re almost ready to set up your server!  
Before beginning the setup process, there are a couple of things you’ll need to do first.

### Login to HexOS

Using your HexOS login, access the HexOS command deck at [deck.hexos.com](https://deck.hexos.com).

If you have not already signed up you can [sign up](https://hub.hexos.com/register/) here.

### Claiming Your Server

Once logged in, you'll need to claim your server.

Your server should appear in the right panel where it says "Looking for servers...".  
Claiming it will require the password you used during the installation process for HexOS.

#### Server Not Showing Up?

Is your server not showing up? Don't worry just yet. You may need to connect manually.  
- Click the "Having Problems" link, followed by "enter your ip manually".
- Enter your  WAN IP address (if you are unsure what that is you can find yours [here](https://whatismyipaddress.com/)).

Once entered, your server should appear and can be claimed.

## Server Setup Process

### Step 1: Health and Capabilities 

After claiming, you'll be brought to a display containing all of your server's hardware.
Make sure you see the correct number of drives and that no errors are being displayed.  
If you see lots of green checks, you're good to go!

### Step 2: Storage Pools

HexOS will suggest a storage pool layout based on your hardware.  
For most people, the recommended configuration is the best path forward.

If you are more of a tinkerer you can remove drives from default pools, or skip pool creation and manually configure later. 

Keep in mind removing drives can reduce redundancy and affect how safely your pools handle failures. Not having enough drives in a pool will also affect your ability to add more drives to the pool later on.

### Step 3: Verification & Server Naming

Complete your setup by verifying everything is working correctly.  
Your pools should reflect the settings you went forward with inside of pool configuration.

Finally, give your server a name and your server is good to go!

### What's Next?

Your server will finish initializing momentarily and bring you to the dashboard.
