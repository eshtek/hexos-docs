# HexOS Q3 2025

**October 1, 2025**  
*By Cole Manel*

We're excited to share what we've been working on this quarter. With this update we are introducing app curation, alongside a few new curated apps. You can now create, customize, and share install scripts for any app you want to see on HexOS. We've also launched our official documentation site, improved the onboarding experience, and added some powerful new folder management features. Let's dive in.

## App Curation

By enabling [experimental features](/features/settings/experimental-features/) in Settings > Preferences, users can now access the Custom Script option for app installs. From there, you can tweak existing [install scripts](/features/apps/install-scripts/overview), create entirely new ones, and share them with the community or [submit them to the official HexOS curation templates](/features/apps/install-scripts/contributing).

To go along with custom installs, we’ve added some fresh curated apps: **Jellyfin**, **Home Assistant**, and **qBittorrent**. We’ll keep building on this curated set over time, and we can’t wait to see the contributions from the community."

## Documentation Site

Alongside app curation, we launched our [official documentation site](https://docs.hexos.com). This centralized resource brings together getting-started guides, feature documentation, troubleshooting help, release notes, and community resources.

It simplifies the process of finding information and helps new users get settled with their hardware. We look forward to seeing how the community contributes to both documentation and apps.

## First Flight Improvements

Our initial onboarding experience left a little to be desired, so we enhanced it. Progress tracking now shows which tasks you've completed and what remains. A persistent banner lives at the top of every page, keeping First Flight guidance accessible across HexOS. These improvements make the platform significantly more approachable for users new to home server management.

## Folder Wizard

Much like manual pool configuration in Q2, [folders](/features/folders/) received a makeover as well. We extended the simple folder creation interface with a wizard-driven process. Along with this UI update, we added several new options. Folders can now be encrypted (if enabled in experimental features), quotas can be set, and you can back up using Time Machine.

This is a crucial step forward as we prepare for other promised features like snapshots, replication, and buddy backup.

## Looking Ahead

Now that Q3 is behind us we can look towards what the team is focusing on next.

We're preparing to upgrade to **TrueNAS SCALE 25.10**, which brings major VM improvements, web-based installation, and NVMe over fabric capabilities.

We're also introducing **Local UI**, addressing one of the most requested features from our community. While the Command Deck remains our primary interface for initial setup and remote access, Local UI ensures you'll have access to the HexOS interface for system management even during Command Deck maintenance windows. This is a core component of our 1.0 release.

The community-driven app curation system is already paying dividends. We're excited to see the library grow organically through community contributions. Between official curations and community submissions, the app ecosystem is going to continue to expand.
