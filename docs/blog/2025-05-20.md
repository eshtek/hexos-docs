# Status Update & ZFS Leadership Call Tonight

**May 20, 2025**  
*By Jonathan Panozzo*

We're making great progress on the Q2 release of HexOS! Today we wanted to share an update on how updates will work, highlight some quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes, and share what's coming next. Plus, there's an exciting ZFS leadership call happening tonight.

## How HexOS Updates Will Work

In our upcoming Q2 release, you'll notice a significant change to the dashboard. The old Health card is being replaced with a new **Activity Center** that provides a more comprehensive view of what's happening on your server. This new Activity Center will be your hub for all notifications including server alerts, updates, user actions, and active tasks.

One important note: when it comes time to update your HexOS system, please do not update the underlying TrueNAS SCALE OS directly through the TrueNAS UI. Instead, wait for update notifications to appear in the HexOS Activity Center. This ensures that updates are applied in a way that maintains compatibility and system stability.

## QoL and Bug Fixes for Q2 Release

We've been hard at work polishing the user experience and squashing bugs. Here are some of the improvements coming in Q2:

### Activity Center

- **Ability to Update HexOS**: System updates will now be delivered through the Activity Center, making it clear when updates are available
- **Improved notification visibility**: All important notifications are now surfaced prominently so you never miss critical information about your system

### Preferences

- **Option to adjust dashboard display**: You'll have more control over what appears on your dashboard, allowing you to customize the interface to your needs

### General Updates

- **Updated storage card**: Better visualization and information about your storage
- **Updated UI island**: Interface refinements throughout the platform
- **Password visibility toggle**: Easily show or hide passwords when entering them
- **Username length increased to 30 characters**: More flexibility for username creation

## Upcoming Developments

We're excited about what's ahead for HexOS:

### Jellyfin Coming in Q3

Following the successful curation of Plex and Immich, **Jellyfin** will be the next curated application added to HexOS. This highly-requested media server will arrive in our Q3 release, giving users another excellent option for managing their home media libraries.

### App Updates in Q3

The ability to update your installed applications directly through HexOS is coming in Q3. This will make maintaining your apps even easier, with updates delivered through the same Activity Center interface.

### First Team Meeting in Chicago

The Eshtek team is growing rapidly. In fact, it's amazing to me that in just a few short months from our debut, we've quadrupled in size. To celebrate this milestone and plan for the future, the entire team will be meeting in person for the first time in early June in Chicago. We're looking forward to this opportunity to collaborate face-to-face and chart the course for HexOS 1.0 and beyond.

We're thrilled with the progress we're making and can't wait to share the Q2 release with you soon. Stay tuned to the forums for the official release announcement!
