# Status Update & ZFS Leadership Call Tonight

**May 20, 2025**  
*By Jonathan Panozzo*

As we hit the half-way mark for Q2, we have a _lot_ to talk about. The next update is still on track and chock full of features, quality of life improvements, and bug fixes. We're having our first official offsite team meeting in just a few short weeks to prepare for our upcoming dev cycles. And if that's not enough, [tonight's ZFS Leadership call](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86163100254?pwd=BOatQ0Q9klbRLERXf4Ret5Wza9CqD3.1) is [looking mighty interesting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qRzDdaFujXZCeO0ZGVkhuNLWk8kBdjTiedvb0PiHR98/edit?tab=t.0). Hope to see you there ;-).

### **How HexOS Updates Will Work**

Once the Q2 update drops for the Command Deck, users will be notice the previous Health card on the dashboard has been replaced with a new Activity card. Within this card, users will get various messages relating to specific actions on the system, including the availability of OS updates.

_A note of caution: users can elect to update the underlying OS through the TrueNAS UI which is accessible from the Settings page (so long as you are on the same network as your server). However, we do not encourage this behavior as a general practice as this update process escapes our control and may break functionality with HexOS in the future._

### **QoL and Bug Fixes for the Q2 Release**

The previous blog post covered some of the big features we're rolling out, but there are also some much needed quality of life updates and bug fixes planned as well. Here's a short list from our dev team:

**Activity Center**

- Ability to Update HexOS
- Better visibility for dismissed and unread notifications/activities

**Preferences**

- Ability to not only turn off display of apps, but also adjust dashboard display (storage, system cards)

**General**

- Updated storage card on UI
- Updated UI island
- Updated password functionality (eye for toggling password visibility)
- Usernames no longer restricted to 8 characters (max 30)

### **Jellyfin & App Updates Coming in Q3**

While we have plans for improvements to both Plex and Immich in our future, I wanted to take a moment to make a public commitment now that our next curated app will be Jellyfin. This completely free and open source solution has a sleek user interface has been a breath of fresh air for many, and I hope to even get Linus from LTT to use it in the not-too-distant future.

In addition, the ability to update apps through the Activity Center will also be coming in Q3. For now, users still need to do updates for apps through the TrueNAS UI itself (Settings -> TrueNAS -> Apps).

### **Eshtek's First Team Meeting in June**

It's amazing to me that in just a few short months from our debut, we've quadrupled in size. It's been absolutely surreal. As mentioned at the beginning of this post, the entire Eshtek team will be gathering together in Chicago, Illinois in early June to wrap up the Q2 update and plan out our next dev cycles. We intend to do these twice a year going forward, and use these sessions to discuss and shape projects for the future.

Thanks again for supporting us on this mission and I'll be back soon with another update!
