# HexOS Q3 2025

**September 30, 2025**  
*By Cole Manel*

It's been a while since our last blog post, and quite a bit has happened!
We've just pushed out a sizable Q3 update, so let's take a look at everything that's happened from March until now.

## Q2 - June 27, 2025 - Manual Pool Configuration, Activity Center, TrueNAS SCALE 24.10.2.2 Update

Before diving into Q3, we want to acknowledge the June release that kicked off the summer. This update delivered on promises we made back in March in our [Q1 status update](/blog/2025-03-07).

### Manual Pool Configuration

Users now have far more control over [pool creation](/features/storage/storage). During setup, you can use HexOS' recommended storage layout, adjust it to your needs, or skip it entirely and handle it later at your convenience. This process extends beyond the initial server setup and into your main storage page, so you can configure it at your convenience.

### Activity Center Replaces Health Card

We completely overhauled [notifications and activity tracking](/features/notifications/). The old Health card became the new Activity Center, which now displays all notifications: server alerts, updates, user actions, and active tasks that may be taking a bit of time.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; align-items: flex-start; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <img src="/assets/screenshots/q2-activity-dropdown.png" alt="Activity Dropdown" style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px; max-width: 48%;" />
  <img src="/assets/screenshots/q2-activity-detail.png" alt="Activity Detail" style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px; max-width: 48%;" />
</div>

All activities are also available in the archive for a complete record of what's happening on your server.

### TrueNAS SCALE 24.10.2.2 Update

With notifications redesigned, and a new activity center, users now have the ability to update the OS on your local sever itself. These types of updates will always propogate to the top so you don't miss them.

### Customizable Location Preferences

Previously, there was no way to alter app locations and other storage preferences. Now users can customize default locations for applications, giving more freedom in how the system functions.

### User Settings & Preferences Sync

As we look toward expanding customization, we laid the groundwork for [user settings](/features/settings/). There is now a dedicated space for theme preferences, language selection, and the ability to toggle visibility on what appears on your dashboard.

### UI and Stability Polish

We refined card layouts across the interface, added password field visibility toggling, increased the username character limit to 30, and shipped numerous behind-the-scenes stability fixes to round out the release.

## Command Deck Updates - July 2025 - Observability, Performance Improvements, Networking Fixes

With these foundational features in place, July was focused on performance, observability, and stability improvements. ([July 7th update](/release-notes/command-deck/2025-07-07), [July 28th update](/release-notes/command-deck/2025-07-28))

We began by instrumenting the Command Deck with detailed request timing metrics. This gave us insight into performance bottlenecks and allowed us to make targeted optimizations.  
You may have noticed things felt a bit snappier.

Building on those insights, we shipped networking fixes for users switching between DHCP and static IP modes, along with a queuing and caching layer for folder operations. This improvement was crucial for users with large folder counts, preventing API overload with TrueNAS while maintaining responsiveness. We also fixed a bug that caused folders to appear missing when a private folder user had been deleted.

## Q3 - September 29, 2025 - New Apps Curation Process, Jellyfin/Home Assistant/qBittorrent Apps, Folder Wizard

September brought another major update: **community-driven app curation**.
*[Read the full release notes](/release-notes/command-deck/2025-09-29)*

By enabling [experimental features](/features/settings/experimental-features/) in Settings > Preferences, users can now access the Custom Script option for app installs. From there, you can tweak existing [install scripts](/features/apps/install-scripts/overview), create entirely new ones, and share them with the community or [submit them to the official HexOS curation templates](/features/apps/install-scripts/contributing).

This is a significant step forward for us; we've empowered the community to curate apps themselves. Want to see your favorite home server app on HexOS? Now you can make it happen.

To demonstrate the system's potential, we immediately added three highly requested apps: **Jellyfin**, **Home Assistant**, and **qBittorrent**. And this is just the beginning.

Of course, with this we plan to continue the curation process for apps we and the community recommend.

### Documentation Site

Alongside app curation, we launched our [official documentation site](https://docs.hexos.com). This centralized resource brings together getting-started guides, feature documentation, troubleshooting help, release notes, and community resources.

It simplifies the process of finding information and helps new users get settled with their hardware. We look forward to seeing how the community contributes to both documentation and apps.

### First Flight Improvements

Our initial onboarding experience left a little to be desired, so we enhanced it. Progress tracking now shows which tasks you've completed and what remains. A persistent banner lives at the top of every page, keeping First Flight guidance accessible across HexOS. These improvements make the platform significantly more approachable for users new to home server management.

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%;">
  <img src="/assets/screenshots/q3-first-flight-banner.png" alt="First Flight Banner" style="width: 100%;" />
  <img src="/assets/screenshots/q3-first-flight-modal.png" alt="First Flight Modal" style="position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%); max-width: 300px; box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);" />
</div>

### Folder Wizard

Much like manual pool configuration in Q2, [folders](/features/folders/) received a makeover as well. We extended the simple folder creation interface with a wizard-driven process. Along with this UI update, we added several new options. Folders can now be encrypted (if enabled in experimental features), quotas can be set, and you can back up using Time Machine.

This is a crucial step forward as we prepare for other promised features like snapshots, replication, and buddy backup.

## Looking Ahead

Now that Q3 is behind us we can look towards what the team is focusing on next.

We're preparing to upgrade to **TrueNAS SCALE 25.10**, which brings major VM improvements, web-based installation, and NVMe over fabric capabilities.

We're also introducing **Local UI**, addressing one of the most requested features from our community. While the Command Deck remains our primary interface for initial setup and remote access, Local UI ensures you'll have access to the HexOS interface for system management even during Command Deck maintenance windows. This is a core component of our 1.0 release.

The community-driven app curation system is already paying dividends. We're excited to see the library grow organically through community contributions. Between official curations and community submissions, the app ecosystem is going to continue to expand.
