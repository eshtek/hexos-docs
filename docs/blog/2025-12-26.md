# Revolutionizing App Management: The HexOS Apps Platform Overhaul
**December 26, 2025**
*By The HexOS Team*

Today, we're thrilled to announce a transformative update to HexOS that fundamentally reimagines how you discover, install, and manage applications on your home server. This isn't just an incremental improvement—it's a complete overhaul of our Apps platform that brings additional capabilities to the HexOS apps ecosystem.

## A New Era of App Discovery

Our new Apps interface introduces intelligent categorization, lightning-fast search, and recommendations that make finding the perfect application as easy as shopping in your favorite app store.

The new interface features:
- **Smart Categories**: Browse through Media & Entertainment, Productivity, Development Tools, Smart Home, and more
- **Instant Search**: We're not cataloging separate from your server to manage deprecations, releaes and urations in a single place which reduces the slow round trip to individual servers. 
- **New Apps Section**: See a list of freshly curated apps as they come online
- **Popular Apps Section**: See what's trending across the entire HexOS community
- **Visual Indicators**: Easily identify supported and experimental fresh curations

## Intelligence Built In: Automatic GPU Configuration

One of the most exciting features in this release is our new intelligent configuration system. HexOS now automatically detects and configures GPU resources for applications that can benefit from hardware acceleration and transcoding.

Imagine installing Plex or Jellyfin and having hardware transcoding "just work" without diving into complex GPU passthrough configurations. That's the magic of our new `$GPU_CONFIG()` macro.  We've found patterns across most systems and can detect your NVIDIA, Intel or AMD gpus directly to configure these applications automatically. 


**Smart Updates**: Our new compatibility layer gives us and community curators the foundation to provide smart configuration updates to better assist us in dealing with the constantly evolving app ecosystem outside of our control.

**Configuration Evolution**: Want to revisit one of those questions during app installation?  Purchased a plex pass for example.  You can now update your configuration without reinstalling.

## The Power of Conditional Logic

Our new macro system brings programming-like intelligence to app configuration without requiring advanced coding.  This empowers curators the ability to predict configurations based on installs of other apps or a prompted question.

For example:
- Enable GPU acceleration? The system automatically configures the necessary resources
- Already have qBittorent installed? Radarr install can detect it and adjust its path mappings accordingly.

This conditional logic lays the foundation for fewer questions during setup, smarter defaults, and configurations that can adapt to your evolving environment.

## Polish 

We've taken hold of some well needed polish across the Command Deck and you will see minor improvements and stability to our overall fit and finish.

## Looking Forward

This release represents a major milestone in our mission to make powerful server technology accessible to everyone. But we're just getting started. Future updates will bring:

- **App Rollback**: Easily revert to previous versions if needed
- **Total Pre Configuration**: With our upcoming payload management to follow 1.0 we will be able to not only install your app intelligently, but also configure it to interact with other apps you may have installed.  Hello simplified *arr suite!

## Available Now

This update is rolling out to all HexOS users today. Your existing app installations will continue working exactly as before, but you'll now have access to all these powerful new features for future installations and updates.

To experience the new Apps platform:
1. Navigate to the Apps section in your HexOS dashboard
2. Explore the new categories and search capabilities
3. Check your installed apps for available configuration updates
4. Try installing a GPU-accelerated app to see automatic configuration in action

## 1.0 is right around the corner
The performance we're seeing in our lab on the alpha of HexOS running locally truly makes the holiday season merry.  We cant wait to release it!  Check out our latest roadmap with other features like Buddy Backups in the pipe. (LINK)
