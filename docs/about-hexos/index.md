# About HexOS

HexOS is software used to run a private home server also known as NAS (Network Attached Storage). A NAS keeps your content secure and private on your own computer, it's like "the cloud" but in your own home.

## Simple Setup

Until now, the biggest barrier to having a NAS has been how complicated the software is to set up. HexOS is designed with simplicity in mind, however. The setup wizard automatically validates your hardware, partitions your system as needed and guides you through the setup process in minutes. You can go "under the hood" and tinker with things too - but it's not necessary.

## Features

Simply install the apps of your choice from the Apps screen. Using apps you can quickly configure your home server to:
- store data and backups
- organise photos
- stream content
- run games and virtual machines 
- and so much more. 

## Bring your own hardware
Other NAS solutions often limit you to their own expensive hardware which can't be updated easily or at all. HexOS gives you the freedom to choose and change hardware on your own, re-using older components or buying something new, the choice is yours. You can also easily add more storage one drive at a time.

## How to get HexOS
