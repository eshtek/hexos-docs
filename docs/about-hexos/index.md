# About HexOS

HexOS is software used to run a private home server also known as NAS (Network Attached Storage). A NAS keeps your content secure and private on your own computer, it's like "the cloud" but in your own home.

## Simplified Setup

Until now, the largest barrier to running a home server was how complicated the software has been to use. This is where HexOS truly shines, with simplicity at its core. The setup wizard automatically validates your hardware, partitions your system as needed and guides you through the setup process in minutes. 

## Features

Simply install the apps of your choice from the Apps screen. Using apps you can quickly configure your home server to:
- store data and backups
- organize photos
- stream content
- run games and virtual machines 
- and so much more. 

## Bring Your Own Hardware

Part of what makes HexOS special is the ability to runs on a wide array of hardware, from repurposed systems to highly custom builds. This allows you to upgrade your servers at will and even pick your favorite brand of storage.

The choice is yours.

## Built On TrueNAS.

HexOS runs on top of TrueNAS Scale: this means that the underlying software is already fully featured and extensively tested. TrueNAS has many Open Source elements and a community of developers and companies contributing to its functionality, security and longevity.

This allows HexOS to really focus on being easy to use and accessible, without having to design every aspect of the software.

This also means that HexOS users have access to a large library of apps that run on TrueNAS, making HexOS feature packed from the start. Users can take a look at the TrueNAS part of their server if they like, or just stick within HexOS.
