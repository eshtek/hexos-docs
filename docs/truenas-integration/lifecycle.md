# App Lifecycle & Roadmap

HexOS extends TrueNAS app management beyond installation.

## Current Features

- **Install** apps using curated Install Scripts
- **Uninstall** apps and clean up datasets
- **Query** app state across multiple hosts
- **Portal Detection** for apps with external endpoints

## Roadmap

### Upgrades
- Compare current and latest chart versions
- Apply upgrades safely with rollback support

### Rollbacks
- Restore from prior chart version or saved Install Script

### Backups
- Snapshot app data pools before upgrades

### Multi-Host
- Federation of apps across multiple TrueNAS hosts
- Namespace separation per host to prevent conflicts

HexOSâ€™s goal is to make **app lifecycle safe, recoverable, and auditable**.
